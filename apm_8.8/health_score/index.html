<p>Please note that the MAS Worldwide (WW) demo environment is NOT a suitable environment for this lab.  The WW demo environment is shared, and making ANY changes to that environment will impact other usersâ€™ ability to demonstrate MAS.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This lab exercise guide is for Maximo Health and Predict. </p>
<p>Maximo Predict uses historical and real-time asset performance data, maintenance records, inspection reports, and environmental data to correlate performance factors that predict asset degradation or failure. Predict uses artificial intelligence to optimize predict model accuracy.</p>
<p>Maximo Health introduced the concept of work queues to provide a consolidated view of the Assets and their health.  It provides Asset Performance KPI view and fleet wide view and health drill down. It also allows you to take actions based on conditions. This may be based on either Inspection or Sensor Data.
<img alt="sample wheel" src="../img/apm_8.7/h1.png" /></p>
<p>Maximo Predict allows for increasing the life of asset. It reduces maintenance costs and improves asset utilization by reducing unnecessary and redundant maintenance based on condition monitoring infused with IoT, AI, and ML. Also, it helps in conducting the proactive maintenances for assets that need attention. </p>
<p>Through this Maximo Health and Predict lab exercise, you will learn how to</p>
<ul>
<li>Get better insight into the health of assets and predict failures well in advance</li>
<li>Reduce unnecessary Preventive Maintenance or doing condition-based monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take about 60 minutes to go through the lab exercise and learn about the Maximo Health and Predict applications. </p>
<p>Note: Follow the <code>Actions</code> steps in bold to navigate through the lab procedures. </p>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p><strong>Age</strong> is the actual age. It is the current date minus the installation date.</p>
<p><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> helps identify unusual patterns in the behavior of the asset, which might indicate potential failures or pre-failure behaviors. </p>
<p><strong>Asset timeline</strong> provides insight into the state of your asset by time in a graphical view. </p>
<p><strong>Asset health</strong> is the overall state of an asset might be based solely on observation or on a driver, such as condition, performance, or cost.</p>
<p><strong>Asset type</strong> is a category for an asset used to manage assets with similar characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Criticality</strong> defines the importance of the asset to business processes. It configures how this score is calculated on the Scoring page.</p>
<p><strong>End of Life Curve</strong> uses retirement and age data for similar assets to estimate the end of life.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Time to Failure</strong> is the number of remaining days the asset could operate before failure. If multiple failure modes are possible, the failure mode with the soonest failure estimate and the user can select a different failure mode to see its estimated failure date.</p>
<p><strong>Factors that contribute to failures</strong> The factors that contribute to failure are the parameters used in the training model to predict the failure of an asset. You can view this information in the failure contribution analysis tree.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong> is an asset health condition indicates that the asset is in minimum operability and can complete its basic functions.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Probability</strong> is the percentage that the asset failure could occur in the selected prediction window.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Probability Trend</strong> is the historical trend of failure probability of the asset during a period.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> is asset health condition indicates that the asset is operating at a high level without problems.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> is the overall condition of the asset. </p>
<p><strong>Health History</strong> is the overall condition of the asset over a period.</p>
<p><strong>Meters</strong> are readings for the asset to determine the operational status.</p>
<p><strong>MRR</strong> is the maintenance-to-replacement ratio (MRR) for the asset. MRR is calculated by dividing the current total cost of all maintenance for the asset, including parts and labor, by the replacement cost. If the percentage is 100% or greater, the current total cost of the asset is greater than the cost to replace the asset.</p>
<p><strong>Next Failure</strong> is the time remaining until the asset is expected to fail based on the predictive model.</p>
<p><strong>Next PM</strong> is the number of days until the next scheduled generation of preventive maintenance (PM) work order. The card is empty if the generation date is the current date or in the past, and no other work order generations are scheduled.</p>
<p><strong>Normalized score</strong> is a rating representing the adjustment of a health score to a common baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Poor</strong> is an asset health condition indicates that the asset has serious problems keeping it from functioning as intended.</p>
<p><strong>RUL</strong> is the remaining percentage of the asset's useful life. The remaining useful life (RUL) is calculated by subtracting the age from the manufacturer's expected life. If the age exceeds the expected life, the RUL is 0%.</p>
<p><strong>Work Queues</strong> provide users with a list of tasks, work or items to review and display the outstanding number of records to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>
<h2 id="lab-overview">Lab Overview</h2>
<p>Through this lab exercise, you will learn how a Reliability Engineer uses the MAS Health and Predict applications to review the asset conditions and ensure that there aren't any failures predicted before planned maintenance. Together, MAS Health and Predict applications provide a view of an enterprise's assets' current state and project future conditions of those assets.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong> </p>
<p>A Water Resource Authority needs to manage wastewater treatment assets across multiple cities and regions from a single application. Pumps are one of the critical assets in the wastewater plant. In this lab exercise, we will learn how a reliability engineer uses the MAS Health and Predict applications to review the pump conditions and ensure that there aren't any failures predicted before planned maintenance.</p>
<p>Health and Predict arm the Reliability Engineer with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime. You can identify assets that need attention, investigate those assets, and finally take an action to avoid unplanned downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Persona</strong></p>
<p>Reliability Engineer manages the reliability risk by ensuring the asset is available and functions without failure. Based on the industry and market, reliability engineers manage multiple assets and processes.</p>

<p>The initial view will show the <code>Groups</code> of assets that have already been created.  Youâ€™ll also see a tab for <code>Ranges</code> and <code>Contributors</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <code>Ranges</code> tab so that we can explore how ranges are created.
<img alt="&quot;Ranges&quot; tab" src="../img/apm_8.7/healthscoring_33.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>On this page, you can see that custom ranges have already been created for health, criticality, and risk scores.  In addition to creating custom ranges, you can also name them, and assign different colors and symbols to each range.</p>
<p>The ability to customize ranges, and scores, is important since each enterprise has different preferences, as well as different risk tolerances. </p>
<ol>
<li>Letâ€™s review the ranges for Health that have already been established. Click on <code>Health</code> at the top of the Health score box.
