In this exercise you will be able to: Upload images to a data set Label those images for Object Detection Increase the number of images using data augmentation Train and deploy a Deep Learning Model Make a project for Inspections Before you begin, make sure you followed the steps in the Prerequisites page. Exercise 1.1 - Creating a Data Set and Image Preparation Log into Maximo Visual Inspections using your credentials. Click Get Started . You should now be in the Data Sets tab. Select Create new data set . Name your net data set Cans data set-YourInitials . Then, Create . Select the bottom half of the data set you just created. You will now drag and drop the 5 images of cans we provided you onto the Drop files here box or click Import files and select the images. Select Add files . Once the images are done uploading, we will begin the labeling process for Object Detection. Click the Select check box next to the Label actions button. Then, click on the Label objects button. We will now add labels of cans that are dented and cans that are not dented. On the right-hand side of the page click Add Label . Type \u201cgood\u201d and then hit the Enter key (or click the Add button). Then, type \u201cbad_dented\u201d and then hit the Enter key (or click the Add button). Click the Ok button when the labels are created. Look at the image and determine whether the can is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad_dented\u201d. Then, click the specific object name for the image and click the Box label. Click and drag your mouse over the can for each label. Labeling each can \"good\" or \"bad_dented.\" Try to get the boxes around the cans as close as possible. If you need to adjust your label, just uncheck the Box label first (box turns BLUE when ACTIVE, BLACK when not active) and use the 4 white corners to adjust the label. You may need to click on one of the can boxes to select it, if the 4 white corner boxes are not showing. You can also select the trash can symbol next to the label on the top right to delete it. Use the Blue Arrow to scroll up and down through all of the images or hover your mouse over and scroll. Label all of the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad_dented\u201d cans in all of the images. Once finished, go back to the data set by clicking the back arrow. Data Augmentation When building out a Deep Learning model the more images you add to your data set, the more accurate your model will be. Maximo Visual Inspection has a data augmentation feature which allows you to expand your original data set by applying one or more operations against the images. You can Blur, Sharpen, Noise, Color, Crop, Vertical Flip, Horizontal Flip, and Rotate your images. This will create a new data set with the added affects you choose. For the purpose of this lab, we will only be using the Horizontal flip and Vertical flip . Now that your imaged have been labeled, let's begin to augment the data. You should be on our Cans data Set-YourInitials in the Data set tab. Now, click on the Augment Data button. Click the Vertical flip checkbox, the Horizontal flip checkbox, and then the Continue button. (you may have to use the scroll bar to the right and scroll down a little to display the vertical and horizontal flip options) Note Under New Creations , you can see how many new images will be created. When prompted, enter Cans-Augmented-YourInitials for the name of the new data set and then click the Create data set button. Wait until the augmentation process completes. (the running status appears in the top right corner) Click on the back button to return to the main data sets page. Your new augmented data set Cans-Augmented-YourInitials should be there, with three times the number of images than in your original data set. Open this new data set that you just created by clicking in the lower half of the tile. You can see how MVI created these new images with each new image having a symbol on it, saving you time from taking more photos. Congrats, you have made a data set that is ready to be trained!","title":"1.1 DataSets"},{"location":"exercise1-2/","text":"Exercise 1.2 - Train and Deploy a Deep Learning Model Train Model: Now that our data set has been created, we are ready to start training our Deep Learning Model. In general, the more images used to train a model, the more accurate the model will be. The Augmented data set will create a better model than the 5 base images. We also have provided you with an even more accurate pretrained model built on 2000+ images. Make sure you are on your Cans-Augmented-YourInitials data set. Click Train model . Give your model the name of Dent Detection Model-YourInitials . Select Object Detection as the type of training and switch Advanced settings on in the top right corner. Scroll down to the Optimize Model using section, select Tiny YOLO v2 as the model type. Select Enable Core ML as the training option, which is what allows the model to be used on an iOS device. In the Model hyperparameters , change Max Iteration to 2000 . Attention We are only using 2000 iterations because we don't want to stretch the GPU too thin. Also, it takes a lot more time to train the model with higher iterations. Increasing the iterations can improve model accuracy, similar to adding more images to a dataset. Click the Train Model button at the top of the page. The MVI Platform will schedule the model training and begin training when the resources become available. The timing of training varies on how many iterations you've chosen and how much data you\u2019re using to train the model. As model training begins, you can move on to the next step and let it run in the background. Deploy Model: While your model is training, we are going to deploy the model that was given to you as part of the lab artifacts. The model was trained using over 2,000 images. Therefore, it will be significantly more accurate than the model you just created. First, select the Models tab. Just like we did with the Data Set .zip file, we will do the same with the Model .zip file. You will drag and drop the Dent Detection Model - Lab.zip file that you saved to your computer or click Import .zip file and select the .zip file. Also, you can click the x on the progress bar for your model that is training if it is in the way. Give at least 4-5 minutes for the model to finished uploading. Once the model has finished uploading, click the checkbox and select the Deploy Model button. Select Deploy . Wait a couple seconds for the model to be deployed. It should look like the picture below when it is ready. Click on the deployed model to see the details of the model. Scroll down to test the model. Drag the Model Test Pic we provided you for testing and drop it into the Test Model box or select Import and upload the picture. This image was not used to train the model. You can see our Deep Learning Model is able to identify which can is good and which can has a dent. On the right side is the color of each label and the confidence scores of how likely it is to be that object. Congrats, you have trained and deployed a model that can be used on Maximo Visual Inspection Mobile!","title":"1.2 Train and Deploy Model"},{"location":"exercise1-3/","text":"Exercise 1.3 - Project Creation for Inspections We will now create a project that will be used on Maximo Visual Inspection Mobile.
