Factors to Consider This recipe employs self-signed certificates and Ansible playbooks to deploy MAS with the default OpenShift domain (suitable for sandbox and learning purposes with limited mobile support). If you want to use valid SSL (CA-signed) certificates with a domain name of your own, contact the author with your sales opportunity (suitable for production, proof-of-concept, and MVPs with full mobile support).

You could also provision Cloud Pak for Data for optionally dependent components such as Watson Machine Learning. This lab will guide you through the process of creating a working instance of Maximo Application Suite using the officially available Ansible automation method. The lab includes all of the necessary Ansible variables in a handy script. The Maximo Application Suite allows users to sign on to a single, integrated platform to access key monitoring, maintenance, and reliability applications across the business. Not only does it help remove data silos, it enhances data sharing with integrated user experience and shared administrative controls for enterprise-scale execution. https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo Disclaimer and limitation This deployment lab is only suitable for sandbox environments. A sandbox environment is typically used only for testing. Self-signed certificates with a default domain will be used in this lab. This lab is not intended for use in production-deployment scenarios.
