Create parent and child relationships between devices and locations to build system hierarchies. Scenario This exercise is based on a fictional company, Acme, that manages transportation networks for a number of clients. Client-ABC delivers a rail transportation network for the oil and gas industry. Client-ABC divides its network into Southern Express, Western Express, Northern Express, Eastern Express. Each region has multiple zones. Each zone has one more trains. Each train has an engine and compressor devices are assigned to each engine. A sensor on each compressor measures the load and pressure of the compressor. When Monitor is installed first in MAS, there is an option to import a CSV file to create the hierarchy. Note: If Monitor is installed after Manage then the asset hierarchy will need to be created in Manage.
