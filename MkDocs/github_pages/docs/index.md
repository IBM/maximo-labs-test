# Welcome to the IBM Maximo Github Pages Lab
This lab will document the steps needed in order to use Github Pages to host the Maximo Labs,
like:

* Changes to the github repo: [Github](../gh_pages/#1-create-a-new-branch-gh-pages)
* Change image location in all md files and modify the build_all_mkdocs script
* Edit mkdocs.yml files for all labs
* ...


A minimized replica of the originial monitor-hands-on-labs has been used in order to get the basics right. The experimentation has been done in a new Github repo in the IBM organization, 
called maximo-labs-test. All the results are documented her in this lab, so it can be used to modify the full Maximo Labs repository.
