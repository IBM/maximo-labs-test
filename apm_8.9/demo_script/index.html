<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this overview task guide you will be Marcia.  She is a Reliability Engineer (RE), whose role is to maintain the 
reliability of the grid.  Her main responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational.  She is also 
responsible for making short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies.<br />
She uses asset condition and operational data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both
today and into the future. </p>
<p>Thankfully, You will have a Health and Predict - Utilities solution from IBM with advanced analytics to help you do your 
work efficiently and confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources. <br />
Health and Predict - Utilities incorporates multiple data sources such as Asset Meter and Work order data, historical 
failure data, GeoSpatial Data, Inspection and Test Logs, IoT and Sensor data.   Health and Predict - Utilities provides 
a flexible Asset condition framework for mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict - Utilities helps you 
identify assets that are at the greatest risk of failure, across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions.<br />
The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep 
the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes.</p>
<p>Maximo Health and Maximo Predict are targeted to the RE, and provide a view of the current state of an enterprise's 
assets, and projects future conditions of those assets.  HPU is an extension of Health and Predict designed specifically 
for the Utilities industry.  Health, Predict, and HPU share the same User Interface (UI).</p>
<h2 id="identify">Identify</h2>
<p><a name="identify"></a></p>
<p>On the “Applications” tab, there are tiles for each of the applications that the admin has loaded from the Maximo Application Suite (MAS).  On the “Industry Solution” tab, there is a tile for Health and Predict – Utilities.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Health and Predict - Utilities arm the RE with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the Utility’s assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the main MAS page, select the <code>Industry solutions</code> tab
<img alt="navigate_to_health" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%201.png" />  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Health and Predict – Utilities tile
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%202.png" />    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On the main screen, there is a universal view of all managed assets in a familiar table view.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>This is particularly valuable because it shows a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view.</p>
</div>
<p>This asset data is coming from Maximo Manage, but MAS can connect to other EAM systems.</p>
<p>Different views of the data can be generated to make it easier to identify critical assets. On this grid, the user can add and move columns, filter, search and sort.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Select the icon next to the magnifying glass to show the column options

<li>Click it again to close
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2030.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>There’s an option to create private views, and public views which are available to everyone.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Saved views allow the user to return to a particular view so that they don’t have to start over every time.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Use the selection box to SHOW the saved view.
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2031.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>In the grid view, there are columns with calculated data.  There are Health scores, which are created for groups of assets from the Scoring tab.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Included with Health and Predict – Utilities are notebooks with predefined industry standard formulas to calculate health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age scores for assets in the Utilities industry.</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, information in the Days to Failure column comes from a predictive model scheduled from the Predict grouping tab</p>
<p><img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2032.png" /></p>
<p>Another view to help identify assets in trouble is the map view.  Using a container with a grid is a particulary good way to demonstrate the capabilities of the map.</p>
<p>Select a group of assets, or a container, that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Seeing how assets are spatially distributed may assist with identifying and investigating assets at risk.  This is particularly true in the Utilities industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Reset the view to show ALL assets as needed.</li>

<li>Click <code>Apply</code>
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2036.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>There are 261 assets in this container.  Sorting by the health score from low to high shows that there are many assets in poor health.  This is concerning given the importance of these assets to the grid performance in the distribution network.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Several column headers can be used to sort to help visualize the data in different ways.</p>

</ol>
<p>Selecting the pin icon in the upper right of the screen shows the selected assets on a map view.</p>
<p>The different pin colors and icons represents the health of the assets, according to the legend at the bottom left of the screen.  This is one more way to quickly understanding which assets are in poor health.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>

<p>Here there’s a substation transformer that likely needs attention.</p>
<p>Note that a user can click on the name to open the asset detail page.  However, there are other methods to identify 
assets in poor health and focus on substation transformers.</p>
<p>The charts view offers an alternative way to identify assets at risk.</p>
<p>Select all substation transformers from the “type” filter, and select the charts view.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Return to the grid view</li>
<li>Reset the view to show ALL assets by clicking on the "container" filter
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2077.png" /></li>
<li>Click the "filter" symbol
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2078.png" /></li>
<li>Select the "pencil" symbol for type

<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2082.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>This page shows 3 charts:
- a health wheel categorizing all of the assets by health
- an unplanned downtime view showing hours of downtime by month
- a chart showing failure rate per manufacturer</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Seeing key KPIs for multi-assets by health distribution, categorized by unplanned downtime or failure rate per </p>
</div>
<p>manufacture can help understand assets failure trends.</p>
<p>Drill-down through each of these charts to see the assets details of each category.</p>
<p>For example, clicking on the manufacturer Boggs shows a 100% failure rate.  So all assets from Boggs have failed.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Click on the manufacturer <code>Boggs</code> to see the failures by that manufacturer
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2083.png" /></li>
<li>Return to the charts page by using the breadcrumb at the top of the page
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2084.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Using “work queues” is another way to identify assets in trouble, and to take an action to avoid unplanned downtime and 
be more proactive in maintenance planning.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Hover over the left nav bar to expand it</li>
<li>Select the <code>Work queues</code> section on the left nav bar
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2085.png" /></li>
<li>Select <code>Failing Before PM</code> work queue
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2086.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help find assets that meet specific conditions.  They can be used by the
reliability engineer to systematically address each asset on the list, in turn, and “work down” the list.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>These are particularly valuable to a RE who needs to address a specific problem, like a utility, trying to avoid </p>
</div>
<p>unplanned downtime.</p>
<p>There are a number of work queues included with Health and Predict.
- There are work queues specific to Predict, like assets with a High Probability of Failure.
- There’s also a work queue for identifying assets in poor health.</p>
<p>And there are work queues that show assets with missing data.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>The missing data work queues are useful for an RE to help identify gaps in data necessary to create health scores or predictive failure models.</p>
</div>
<p>The “Failing before PM” work queue shows all of the assets with scores in that work queue.  As a RE at a Utilities plant, it is critical to avoid failures.
- In this work queue, there are several pumps and substation transformers that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date.
- 2 of the transformers are in the container that was viewed earlier.
- Select “ST_1400518” in the queue to start managing the workload for the day, investigating and addressing all of the assets in the queue.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Select <code>ST_1400518</code> which opens the asset detail page [DETAILS ON THIS PAGE WILL VARY AS THIS IS A LIVE DEMO SYSTEM]

</ol>
<h2 id="investigate">Investigate</h2>
<p><a name="investigate"></a></p>
<p>On the top of the asset detail page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation transformer.  These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score.  Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score.  An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age.</p>
<p>On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score.</p>
<p><img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2088.png" /></p>
<p>The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets.  Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state.</li>
<li>For this asset, there is a health score of 44, which is in the medium “fair” zone.  </li>
<li>This asset also has a high criticality and low risk score. </li>
<li>This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure, based on the install date and manufacturers recommended life.</li>
<li>The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning of the investigation, the asset was expected to fail before its planned maintenance.  But, just by looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken.</p>

<p>IBM Predict includes templates to help a Data Scientist get started building models to project days to failure, calculate probability of failure, detect anomalies, and generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and retirement dates.  These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the optimal outcome.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models.</p>
<p>In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days...plus or minus 1 day. </p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the richness of the failure history, a Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes.  And the RE can select those failure modes within the widget to see the projection for each.</li>
<li>Also in the widget, there is information about the training data to help decide when a </li>
</ul>
<p>The Failure probability widget can show how different failure modes impact predictions.  For example, it might show the asset has a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating.
- A Data Scientist can build specific models for time periods.  And just like the failure modes, the user can look at the results by making different selections within the widget.
- Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode has changed over time.</p>
<p>The factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures.
The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the widget.</p>
<p>The end of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned.   By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure.</p>
<p>The effective age of the transformer is 27 years.  The curve produces an end of life probability of  89%...one more piece of evidence to show that this asset needs to be attended to immediately.</p>
