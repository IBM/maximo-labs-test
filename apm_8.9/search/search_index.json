Maximo Health includes Asset Investment Optimization templates that you can use to see which strategies work best to meet your business goals. In this exercise you will use Health to: Setup Score to calculate asset condition. Create Health Asset Scoring Group to have a group of assets that you can view and work with. Matrix Page to identify and quantify the number of assets that need attention. Asset Investment Project to decide which strategy is best to action the assets Prerequisites This lab requires the following: A working Maximo Application Suite (MAS) environment with Maximo Manage, or another Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system, Maximo Health, Maximo Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities (HPU), and Maximo Optimizer installed. Sufficient asset data to run the analysis and get insights Setup Scores As a reliability engineer, You use Maximo Health, Predict, and Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities to identify assets with a custom score that needs attention. You investigate those assets and take actions to improve the condition of those assets. Custom scores allow me to apply my knowledge as an SME (subject matter expert) to create ways of measuring the condition of my assets. Navigate to Health and Predict - Utilities You will start from the main MAS screen, and select the Health application from the Suite navigator page or from Industry solutions tab. You will create a custom score for a subset of these assets. You will start from the main MAS screen, and select the Health Predict - Utilities application. Select the Industry solutions tab. Review the assets in the Assets Grid page to see over 10 thousand assets under management. Setup Score Type To create a custom score, You will select the Scoring and DGA Setting tab on the left navigation bar in Maximo Health.

See image below to check the settings. Click Save Review your Score settings that you just created. Value: Creating custom ranges allows me to enforce my company specific measurement method for the asset condition score or using engineering formulas. Create Health Score Group Create a Health Asset scoring view so that you can work with your custom asset scores in the Assets Grid , Assets Details , Map and Matrix pages. You can build out a custom score to apply to a specific group of assets. Groups allow you to scope the score to a query of assets and a method for calculating the scores. return to the Groups tab, and click the Create a scoring and DGA group . You will complete the fields. For this example, we\u2019ll create our score using the Building Scores capability rather than the Connecting group to notebook option. You will use the query function to identify the assets in my group then create the group. From the left cascading menu click Scoring and DGA settings . Click the Groups tab. If you don't have a group for pumps you can click Create a scoring and DGA group and fill in the form. Click button Create a scoring DGA group to specify the assets, query to use and method of calculation. Building scores uses the easy to use forumula based approach. The notebook approach requires access to Watson Studio which comes with Predict. Select a query that matches the assets you would like to include in this group. Search for the Query name and click Apply button. If you don't see one that fits your need the next steps explains how to create a query to choose the right assets to add your score to. You can create a query if you don't see one that matches the assets where you want to use your new score. Edit your group by clicking on the pencil icon. Click + to add a new query instead of selecting one. Enter the values required in the query form for name , description , and filters to use to query Health for the right assets. Click Create and apply button to save the query. Review the assets in the scored assets list to ensure the assets you want to have this score in are are listed. If this is a new group, you must create and apply your changes to save it. Create and save the score group by pressing the Create button. You can not add scores to your Health Score group. Click the Add Score button. if you already have added your custom score type. Choose the score by clicking on the Score name tile and the Done button. For example select Centrifugal Pump Efficieny score and the Done button to add this score to the pump group. If the Contributors haven't yet been setup continue on to the next exercise to create them and add them. Value: Grouping common assets together allows us to apply our custom custom condition score to multiple assets rather than one at a time thus easing administration. Setup Contributor Contributors describe what child metrics, meter readings, inspections, KPIs and other values should be considered as part of the overall normalized score. With groups created, you will click Add score and contributors to the score. Efficiency may be made of one or more calculated or metered data. In this example you will learn the different ways of creating a contributor. Including duplicating an existing contributor and creating a new contributor. If you haven't opened your score group. Open it now. Once on your score group, your first options is to click the + icon to add an existing contributor to your group. This could be made up of previous contributors to a score that you created. Click the Contributor tile and click Add button. Your second option is to create a new contributor for your CENTRIFUGALPUMPEFFICIENCY and enter the values in the form. Do the latter. After clicking + icon click Create Contributor button. The third option is to Duplicate an existing contributor button to copy and reuse an existing contributor PUMPEFFICIENCY to fill in the Contributor form with. Review the values that were filled in. Make changes you need. Adjust what that maximum and minimum allowed values are. Click the Create button to save your changes to your duplicated contributor. Click the adjust the worst and best score to reflect your score ranges for low, medium and high. Click on CENTRIFUGALPUMPEFFICIENCY score to expand and see all the contributors that contribute to it. Note The contributor formula is related to the pump meter data, for example, asset could be using different meter name will results a different formula, e.g ((METERVAL(\"P-HEAD\") * 0.3 * 9.8 * METERVAL(\"P-FLOW\") * 0.0037 * 60) * 100) / (((METERVAL(\"P-VOLTAGE\") * METERVAL(\"P-CURRENT\") * 1.732050807569 * 0.75 * 0.8 * 0.9)/1000)*3600) , P-HEAD , P-FLOW .etc is defined in hpu_csv_demo data set at https://github.ibm.com/Watson-IoT/eam-hpu-lab/csv-files Click the pencil icon. Set each contributor the percent to 50% since this score will only have two contributor which will then contribute 100% together. Click 'Save' Confirm the changes that 100% of the contributors value will be allocated to the CENTRIFUGALPUMPEFFICIENCY score. Activate Score Activating a score lets other users know that the score is available to be used to measure asset conditions. The custom score will appear available for other users to use. Before You can activate the score, You have to assign the factor that You selected a percentage that this measure contributes to overall normalized score value. Since there\u2019s only 1 factor, You will assign it 100%. If you haven't opened your score group. Open it now. Click Active slider to enable the score to start calculating when invoked. Click the breadcrumbs for Chilled water pump to return to the score group. Once on your score group, check to make sure the column for the Centrifugal Pump Efficiency Score is Y in the Active column in the Scores table.

Add Custom Score to Asset Grid Table Navigate to the Asset Grids page. Select a pump query from the drop down. In the assets table, click on Manage Columns icon and then Manage Columns link. Search on Centrifugal Pumps in the search bar and then check the row that has Centrifugal Pumps score in the description column. From the Assets Grid page select your saved query for the Centrifugal Pumps . Click on the on Centrifugal Pump Efficiency score column header to sort the asset rows by the worst performing scoring pump. Click on the Pump-1001 to ensure the Centrifugal score shows up as a value card on the Asset Details page Create View Create a Health Asset scoring view so that you can work with your custom asset scores in the Assets Grid pages and see the score as column . Go to the Asset Grid page. Enter PUMP-100 without last digit as shown below. Click the dropdown with the view: names. Scroll up to save your view. Name it Centrifugal Pumps . Save the view as a private view so that no one but you can see it. Value: By creating a view and adding your custom score to your asset grid you can more quickly find the assets that aren't performing well. This makes it easier to analyze and take action to repair or replace poor performing assets. Setup Assets Matrix In this step you will identify assets that need attention by using the Matrix page. To identify assets that are having poor 'Centrifugal Pump Efficiency Score' and in poor health, You will use the new CENTRIFUGALPUMPEFFICIENCY score along with the Matrix page. From the left nav, You will click assets , and then the Matrix icon on the upper right of the screen. You will create a matrix using my new score Criticality , and Centrifugal Efficiency . But first, You will first select the query for Centrifugal Pumps. The results will then only show Centrifugal Pumps on the Assets Grid, Risk, Charts and Map pages. To customize the matrix, You will click the Gear icon in the upper right of the screen on the Matrix . You will adjust the fields so that Criticality appears on the Y axis, and Centrifugal Pump Efficiency on the X axis. You will also fill in the colors of the Matrix so that the assets with poor health and poor Centrifugal Pump Efficiency score show up in the lower right corner. Finally, you'll save the Matrix configuration so others will be able to use it. Click Assets icon in the left nav Click the Matrix icon on the upper right of the screen Note that the default Matrix doesn't show any asset counts in Matrix becuase none of the assets in the query have values for both Health and Centrifugal Pump Efficiency . Click the Version drop down select box and choose Health and Criticality Notice how the Matrix now populates with asset counts in each row and column for Criticality A to E ranges and Health Good , Fair and Poor ranges. Click the Gear icon to configure a new Matrix version. After choosing Criticaly for Centrifugal Pump Efficiency score for the X axis notice how the table cells turn gray. You must manually set the color ranges to reflect what cells you want the reliability engineer to focus on. Click on each range color in the legen and then click on each Matrix cell you want to have that color. Give the Matrix Version a new name and description and check that the direction of each axis for good versus bad is correct. Click Save As to save it as a new Matrix version. Value: By adding your custom score to your asset Matrix page you can more quickly find the assets that aren't performing well. This makes it easier to take action to replace them using Asset Investment Optimization. Add Assets to an Exiting Asset Investment Project In this exercise you will drill into the poor condition scored assets. Evaluate and choose the ones you would like to add to and existing Asset Investment Project. By clicking on each matrix cell you can drill into asset counts to see which assets are included in the count of assets in that range. You action the assets by choosing the assets in the drilled in table list and adding to a new or existing asset investment project. Actions: Click the Red cell links in the Matrix. Review the list of assets. Select all the assets by clicking the top check box or choose individual assets by clicking the check boxes next to that assets you want. You can click the icon on the top right to Add to an existing investment project or create new investment project Choose the latter. Summary Congratulations.

This workshop will use a common environment provided by your instructor. Please follow the steps in this task guide. Any deviation from the task guide and or changes you make to the system will also appear and may impact other users. Since this is a live system, some changes are inevitable, and you may find that some of the details of the task guide do not match the system. For this overview, the following are required, and have been created by your instructor. Lab Section Data Required Group (with scores) EUORG1_EUDEMO_ST_A Group (with scores) ST_EFFICIENCY Score Type Substation Efficiency Custom Matrix Efficiency and Health Investment Project ST Investment Project Plan Template SUBSTATION_TRANSFORMER If your instructor hasn't added the data, ask him to follow the steps in Build MAS Health and Predict Demonstration Introduction In this overview task guide you will be Marcia. She is a Reliability Engineer (RE), whose role is to maintain the reliability of the grid. Her main responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational. She is also responsible for making short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies. She uses asset condition and operational data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both today and into the future. Thankfully, You will have a Health and Predict - Utilities solution from IBM with advanced analytics to help you do your work efficiently and confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources. Health and Predict - Utilities incorporates multiple data sources such as Asset Meter and Work order data, historical failure data, GeoSpatial Data, Inspection and Test Logs, IoT and Sensor data. Health and Predict - Utilities provides a flexible Asset condition framework for mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict - Utilities helps you identify assets that are at the greatest risk of failure, across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions. The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes. Maximo Health and Maximo Predict are targeted to the RE, and provide a view of the current state of an enterprise's assets, and projects future conditions of those assets. HPU is an extension of Health and Predict designed specifically for the Utilities industry. Health, Predict, and HPU share the same User Interface (UI). Identify On the \u201cApplications\u201d tab, there are tiles for each of the applications that the admin has loaded from the Maximo Application Suite (MAS). On the \u201cIndustry Solution\u201d tab, there is a tile for Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities. Value Health and Predict - Utilities arm the RE with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the Utility\u2019s assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime. Actions Follow the action items below. From the main MAS page, select the Industry solutions tab Click the Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities tile On the main screen, there is a universal view of all managed assets in a familiar table view. Value This is particularly valuable because it shows a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view. This asset data is coming from Maximo Manage, but MAS can connect to other EAM systems. Different views of the data can be generated to make it easier to identify critical assets. On this grid, the user can add and move columns, filter, search and sort. Actions Follow the action items below. Select the icon next to the magnifying glass to show the column options Click it again to close There\u2019s an option to create private views, and public views which are available to everyone. Value Saved views allow the user to return to a particular view so that they don\u2019t have to start over every time. Actions Follow the action items below. Use the selection box to SHOW the saved view. In the grid view, there are columns with calculated data. There are Health scores, which are created for groups of assets from the Scoring tab. Value Included with Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities are notebooks with predefined industry standard formulas to calculate health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age scores for assets in the Utilities industry. Similarly, information in the Days to Failure column comes from a predictive model scheduled from the Predict grouping tab Another view to help identify assets in trouble is the map view. Using a container with a grid is a particulary good way to demonstrate the capabilities of the map. Select a group of assets, or a container, that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. Value Seeing how assets are spatially distributed may assist with identifying and investigating assets at risk. This is particularly true in the Utilities industry. Actions Follow the action items below. Reset the view to show ALL assets as needed. Click the \u201cfilter\u201d symbol Select the \u201cpencil\u2019 symbol for containers Select NIXON9098 Click OK Click Apply There are 261 assets in this container. Sorting by the health score from low to high shows that there are many assets in poor health. This is concerning given the importance of these assets to the grid performance in the distribution network. Value Several column headers can be used to sort to help visualize the data in different ways. Actions Follow the action items below. Click Health in the title bar to sort Selecting the pin icon in the upper right of the screen shows the selected assets on a map view. The different pin colors and icons represents the health of the assets, according to the legend at the bottom left of the screen. This is one more way to quickly understanding which assets are in poor health. Actions Follow the action items below. Click Map button Adjust the map using the controls and mouse By turning on the Container selection, a polygon will appear around the assets in the container. The color of the container will reflect the overall health of the container. Actions Follow the action items below.

Actions Follow the action items below. Click the \u201cHealth\u201d button to return to the original view Hover over assets and the container Clicking on the container will show all of the scores on a single card. Actions Follow the action items below. Click the container NIXON9098 Value The KPIs displayed on the preview card gives us an overall summary of the assets in this region, or the container. Zoom in and click on each of the pins to view the key KPIs of the selected asset. By clicking the \u201cAction\u201d button, the user can create plans, add a flag, or submit a work order. Actions Follow the action items below. Zoom in Click the pin for \"ST_1400518\" to see the card Click on the action tab to see the options Here there\u2019s a substation transformer that likely needs attention. Note that a user can click on the name to open the asset detail page. However, there are other methods to identify assets in poor health and focus on substation transformers. The charts view offers an alternative way to identify assets at risk. Select all substation transformers from the \u201ctype\u201d filter, and select the charts view. Actions Follow the action items below. Return to the grid view Reset the view to show ALL assets by clicking on the \"container\" filter Click the \"filter\" symbol Select the \"pencil\" symbol for type Select substation transformers from the list Click OK Click Apply Select the 3rdth icon in the upper right of the screen to see the selected assets on a chart view This page shows 3 charts: - a health wheel categorizing all of the assets by health - an unplanned downtime view showing hours of downtime by month - a chart showing failure rate per manufacturer Value Seeing key KPIs for multi-assets by health distribution, categorized by unplanned downtime or failure rate per manufacture can help understand assets failure trends. Drill-down through each of these charts to see the assets details of each category. For example, clicking on the manufacturer Boggs shows a 100% failure rate. So all assets from Boggs have failed. Actions Follow the action items below. Click on the manufacturer Boggs to see the failures by that manufacturer Return to the charts page by using the breadcrumb at the top of the page Using \u201cwork queues\u201d is another way to identify assets in trouble, and to take an action to avoid unplanned downtime and be more proactive in maintenance planning. Actions Follow the action items below. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it Select the Work queues section on the left nav bar Select Failing Before PM work queue Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help find assets that meet specific conditions. They can be used by the reliability engineer to systematically address each asset on the list, in turn, and \u201cwork down\u201d the list. Value These are particularly valuable to a RE who needs to address a specific problem, like a utility, trying to avoid unplanned downtime. There are a number of work queues included with Health and Predict. - There are work queues specific to Predict, like assets with a High Probability of Failure. - There\u2019s also a work queue for identifying assets in poor health. And there are work queues that show assets with missing data. Value The missing data work queues are useful for an RE to help identify gaps in data necessary to create health scores or predictive failure models. The \u201cFailing before PM\u201d work queue shows all of the assets with scores in that work queue. As a RE at a Utilities plant, it is critical to avoid failures. - In this work queue, there are several pumps and substation transformers that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date. - 2 of the transformers are in the container that was viewed earlier. - Select \u201cST_1400518\u201d in the queue to start managing the workload for the day, investigating and addressing all of the assets in the queue. Actions Follow the action items below. Select ST_1400518 which opens the asset detail page [DETAILS ON THIS PAGE WILL VARY AS THIS IS A LIVE DEMO SYSTEM] Investigate On the top of the asset detail page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation transformer. These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score. Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score. An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age. On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score. The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage. Value The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets. Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state. For this asset, there is a health score of 44, which is in the medium \u201cfair\u201d zone. This asset also has a high criticality and low risk score. This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure, based on the install date and manufacturers recommended life. The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days. At the beginning of the investigation, the asset was expected to fail before its planned maintenance. But, just by looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page To learn more about the health of the asset, go to the \u201cScore details\u201d widget. Expand the view to see the contributors by clicking the chevrons to view the details. Value Viewing the contributors and the scores can give insight into the why a particular score is trending in one direction or the other. The \u201cHealth history\u201d widget of this asset is below the \u201cScore widget\u201d. The asset health has been low for some time. One more indication that this asset needs attention. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page The application supports critical asset-specific calculations and visualizations. Dissolved gas analysis is an example for the transformers. It offers two types of visualization widgets. The first one is Duval triangle. It shows the current dissolved gas situation. Click on each of the dots to get detailed information. Click the switcher on the top-right corner to view the result in the list view. The other widget is the history of combustible gas concentrations. It shows the combustible gas trend and rating over time The rating represents the average acceptability of detected gas concentrations. The rating is determined by the overall factor. Hover on each of the assessment dates to get the detailed information. There are several predictive models built to score against incoming sensor data for the asset. Value IBM Predict includes templates to help a Data Scientist get started building models to project days to failure, calculate probability of failure, detect anomalies, and generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and retirement dates. These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the optimal outcome. Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days...plus or minus 1 day. Depending on the richness of the failure history, a Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes. And the RE can select those failure modes within the widget to see the projection for each. Also in the widget, there is information about the training data to help decide when a The Failure probability widget can show how different failure modes impact predictions. For example, it might show the asset has a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. - A Data Scientist can build specific models for time periods. And just like the failure modes, the user can look at the results by making different selections within the widget. - Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode has changed over time. The factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures. The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the widget. The end of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned.

These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score. Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score. An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age. On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score. The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage. Value The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets. Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state. For this asset, there is a health score of 44, which is in the medium \u201cfair\u201d zone. This asset also has a high criticality and low risk score. This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure, based on the install date and manufacturers recommended life. The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days.

Click on each of the dots to get detailed information. Click the switcher on the top-right corner to view the result in the list view. The other widget is the history of combustible gas concentrations. It shows the combustible gas trend and rating over time The rating represents the average acceptability of detected gas concentrations. The rating is determined by the overall factor. Hover on each of the assessment dates to get the detailed information. There are several predictive models built to score against incoming sensor data for the asset. Value IBM Predict includes templates to help a Data Scientist get started building models to project days to failure, calculate probability of failure, detect anomalies, and generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and retirement dates. These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the optimal outcome. Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days...plus or minus 1 day. Depending on the richness of the failure history, a Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes. And the RE can select those failure modes within the widget to see the projection for each. Also in the widget, there is information about the training data to help decide when a The Failure probability widget can show how different failure modes impact predictions. For example, it might show the asset has a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. - A Data Scientist can build specific models for time periods. And just like the failure modes, the user can look at the results by making different selections within the widget. - Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode has changed over time. The factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures. The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the widget. The end of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned. By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure. The effective age of the transformer is 27 years. The curve produces an end of life probability of 89%...one more piece of evidence to show that this asset needs to be attended to immediately. Actions Follow the action items below.

The templates can be used for detecting anomalies and predicting asset failures of assets and for other purposes using Health and Predict - Utilities. Starting with v8.9, you can use the new auto upload feature to more efficiently upload Predict notebooks into your Watson Studio project. This is an enhancement from the previous method, which required users to manually retrieve multiple credentials and upload notebooks into Watson Studio one-by-one. After the auto upload is complete, you can start using the Predict library PMlib and the Watson Studio notebooks right away. Get URL and User credentials to access Watson Studio. Create a project in Watson Studio. Auto upload Predict notebooks to automatically retrieve credentials and upload Predict notebooks into Watson Studio. Use Watson Studio Python library ibm_watson_studio_lib to do to work with data assets in your project. Get URL and User credentials to access Watson Studio Ask your Maximo Application Suite administrator to get your user name and password for Watson Studio, API keys and URL that you will use to connect to Watson Studio. You or he can use these steps to get them. To get the Watson Studio URL, login to Maximo Application Suite. Click on Adminstration Click on Configurations and Watson Studio Click on System After you create the Watson Studio User be sure to make note of the URL, user name and password. You will use it to login to Cloud Pak for Data later with it. Open a browser to the URL and use the credentials from the previous steps to login to Cloud Pak for Data. After logging in you see your Watson Studio Overview page. Note Ensure Datascience User Belongs to Predict Security Group. In Maximo Manage, add the user to the PREDICT and PREDICTGROUPING group in the user definition as shown in the screen below. Create a Project in Watson Studio Watson Studio projects are where you: Keep your model templates Data Assets Train deploy and many the Models Create and manage environment for training and deploying your models. Create a project so that you can add and setup Health, Predict and Utilities notebooks using the auto upload feature. Click on 'All Projects' where you will then create a new project. Click 'New Project'. Accept default and click 'Next'. Click 'New Empty Project'. Enter a project name and description. After creating the project, you can now continue to upload your Predict notebooks into Watson Studio. Auto Upload Predict Notebooks The new auto upload feature saves considerable amount of time and allows the user to start using Predict right away. It should take less than 15 minutes to complete the entire upload. All the work is automatically done by Predict workspace\u2019s Ansible operator in the background. To start the auto upload, you need to get the Project ID from the Watson Studio project you just created and add it to Predict\u2019s workspace configuration. Go to the Manage tab. Find and copy the Project ID. Alternatively, you can also retrieve it from the URL. Login to MAS to enter the Project ID. Click on the Administration icon on the top right corner. On the sidebar menu, select Workspace Make sure that you are on the Overview tab. Scroll down to find the Predict widget. Click on Predict to access the Predict workspace details. Click on he Action menu. Click on Update configurations . Click the Edit button next to IBM Watson Studio Settings to update Predict configurations. Scroll down to Advanced settings and find IBM Watson Studio Project Settings . The System managed setting is turned on by default. Toggle it off so that you can enter the project ID. You should be able to see the project ID field after turning the toggle off. Paste the project ID that you retrieved from your Watson Studio project. For instances outside of of IBM hardware, you may need to specify the IBM Watson Machine Learning URL, for more details see Setup IBM Watson Machine Learning URL A popup will show up asking for confirmation to activate Predict. Click Activate to apply change and start activation. It should take roughly 15 minutes to upload all the data files and notebooks into Watson Studio. You can see the status in a widget in the details section. Once the upload is complete, go back to Cloud Pak for Data and go to your Watson Studio project. Click on the Assets tab, and you should see that all the data files are successfully uploaded, including the Predict Python PMlib zip file and the Db2 certificate file, in the data section. The process also auto-constructs an environment file. This is done by automatically retrieving 3 credentials needed to construct the file: APM _ID , APM_API_BASEURL , and EXTERNAL_APM_API_BASEURL . The only piece that was not automatically constructed is the APM_API_KEY . Please refer to one of the previous lab versions if you would like to manually find environment variables used in Predict. Note If you are logging into Cloud Pak for Data with a user other than the standard admin user, you must grant the admin user access to your project. Failure to do so will prevent Manage from exporting the data into your project with an error 'Specified project ID does not exist'. Using Watson Studio Library The Watson Studio Python Library named ibm_watson_studio_lib allows you to do to work with data assets in your project. Some examples you will learn later are reading and writing data from your project. Another example is getting the Watson Studio Project Information. You will use a Watson Studio Python library named ibm_watson_studio_lib that is available in your environment by default to get your project information. See this API reference for more information. Sample Code # Get the Watson Studio Project Information from ibm_watson_studio_lib import access_project_or_space wslib = access_project_or_space() project_name = wslib.here.get_name() wslib.show(project_name) project_id = wslib.here.get_ID() wslib.show(project_id) Congratulations you have seen how to create a project auto upload Predict notebooks in Watson Studio, including the PMlib documentation you will use in the next exercises. Finally you learned how to use the ibm_watson_studio_lib to work with assets in your project.
