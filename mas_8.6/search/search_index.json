The Engineer also monitored all of the enterprise\u2019s pumps in near-real time, applyingAI anomaly detection to eliminate false positive alerts. They investigated an asset in trouble, and submitted a service request all from a set of dashboardsin Maximo Monitor. We talked about how our supervisor may create a work order in Maximo Manage for our technician, or it can be automatically generated. And, that technician used Maximo Mobile to remotely complete the w/o, and received AI assistance with Maximo Assist and Parts Identifier. When our technician had a man-down situation, our Safety Officer was able to detect the problem, communicate with the technician, provide assistance, and ultimately identify the root cause of the problem with Maximo Safety. And finally, our Reliability Engineer continued the investigation, using Maximo Health and Predict to better understand the current and future states of the pumps, identify potential problems, and take actions using AI-driven insights to avoid unplanned downtime. All of these applications are delivered in the Maximo Application Suite and can address any, or all, of the roles we discussed today.","title":"7.

Health Overview Now that one asset has been identified as creating multiple alerts, the Operations Manager asked the Reliability Manager to dig deeper into all of the similar pumps, to make sure that there aren't any failures predicted to occur before planned maintenance. Maximo Health and Predict are targeted to the reliability engineer. Together, they provide a view of the current state of an enterprise's assets, and project future conditions of those assets. Action: Select Health Application in the right corner and show grid view of assets in health. Value: Health and Predict arm the Reliability Engineer with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the assets, reduce maintenance cost, and eliminate unplanned downtime. As the Reliability Engineer, I'll identify assets the need attention, investigate those assets, and finally take an action to avoid unplanned downtime. Review Asset's Health Action: From the main MAS screen, click on the Health tile to show grid view of assets in Maximo Health and Predict. On the main screen, I can see a universal view of my managed assets in a familiar grid view. Value: This is particularly valuable to me as the Reliability Engineer because I can see a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view. These assets are coming from Maximo Manage, but we can connect to other EAM systems. Different views of our data can be generated to make it easier to identify our critical assets. On this grid, I can add and move columns, filter, search and sort. Value: I've created a saved view to so that I don\u2019t have to start over every time. This view includes a status column, filters on my pumps, and sorts them by OEM and non-OEM. Action: Use the selection box to show your saved view(the \u201cPump\u201d view in the demo may be different) In this view, I can see two columns with calculated data. \u2022 You can see Health scores, which are created within the Health application for groups of assets from the Scoring tab. Action: Show Health Scores under health column and Scoring Tab on the left Tab view. Value: Risk tolerance can vary among industries, asset types, and enterprises. I can define the scoring ranges specific to my tolerance levels. I can even assign my own colors. \u2022 Similarly, information in the Days to Failure column comes from a predictive model from the Predict Grouping tab. Action: Show Predict Grouping Tab on left Tab menu. I can see that my pumps are in various states of health, but in general, my OEM pumps are in better health. Based on the information I\u2019ve received from the ops manager, I suspect that my all of my non-OEM pumps are all have issues with their o-rings. Action: Search pmpd and click Map icon. Note that by selecting the icon in the upper right of the screen, I can also see my selected assets on a map view, with similar information. Value: Seeing how the assets are spatially distributed may assist the Reliability engineer with identify and investigating assets at risk. This is particularly true in the Utilities industry. Work Queue I\u2019ll continue my investigation to determine which assets are expect to fail soon, but don\u2019t have a maintenance plan to address the failure. I want to do those to avoid unplanned downtime, and be more proactive in my maintenance planning. The easiest way to do this is by using the work queue feature. Action: Select Work queues tab on the Left Tab menu, and Show work queues. Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help you find what you're looking for...and to manage your day-to-day activities. Value: These are particularly valuable to a Reliability Engineer who needs to address a specific problem, like a water treatment plant, trying to avoid unplanned downtime. There are a number of work queues included with Health and Predict. \u2022 There are work queues specific to Predict, like assets with a High Probability of Failure. \u2022 There's also a work queue for identifying assets in poor health. \u2022 And there are work queues that show assets with missing data. Value: The missing data Work Queues are extremely useful to a reliability engineer as they can help identify gaps in data necessary to create health scores or predictive failure model. I'll select the Failing Before PM work queue to see all of the assets with scores in that work queue. As a Reliability Engineer at a Water treatment plant, it is critical for me to avoid pump failures. Action: Select Failing before PM work queue. \u2022 In this work queue, we can see that there are 4 pumps that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date, and they are all non-OEM pumps. Note Recorded in a previous date. \u2022 We can see the pump here, the one with the bad o-ring that our technician discovered. \u2022 I'll select a different pump in the queue as we start to manage our workload for the day, investigating and addressing all of the assets in the queue. Action: Select pump 1 which opens the asset detail page [DETAILS ON THIS PAGE WILL VARY AS THIS IS A LIVE DEMO SYSTEM] Health Score Action: Show asset detail page. The asset detail page is an incredibly useful tool for investigating assets. We can find all the asset information presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. \u2022 On the top of the page, I see details about my asset, and KPIs that give me a snapshot of its current state. \u2022 For this asset, we have a health score of xx, which is in our yellow zone. We can also see that it has dropped xx points since it was last calculated Action: Show health score and small number next to health score at the top. \u2022 This asset also has a criticality and risk score. These too can be calculated in a similar manner to the Health Score. \u2022 We can see this asset has xx% of its expected remaining useful life, based on the install date and manufacturers recommended life. Action: Show 'RUL' card at the top. \u2022 We can see that our asset is projected to fail in the next x days, but our next maintenance isn't planned for x days. Action: Show 'Next Failure' card and 'Next PM' card at the top. \u2022 When we started our investigation, we knew the asset was expected to fail before its planned maintenance. But, just by looking at the KPIs, we have additional evidence that this asset is in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken Below the KPI sections, we can see more information about our asset, which comes directly from our EAM system...in this case, Maximo Manage, also included with the Maximo Application Suite. There's a breakdown of the health score drivers and factors that give us insight into what's causing its poor health. Action: Scroll to health details and click the arrows to show metrics. For this asset, and assets in the same group, we can see that the health score is a weighted average of open work orders, remaining useful life, and meter health. Predict Overview Action: Scroll down from asset Health into the Predictions Tab, and open the tab. There are several predictive models built to score against incoming sensor data for our asset. Value: IBM Predict includes templates to help our Data Scientist get started building models to project days to failure, calculate probability of failure, detect anomalies, and generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and retirement dates.\u202f These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits our data for the optimal outcome. Note that also included with the Maximo Application Suite is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which our Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. Predicted Failure Model In the case of our asset, our model tells us that it is projected to fail in xx days...plus or minus xx days. Depending on the richness of our failure history, our Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes. And we can select those failure modes within the widget to see the projection for each. Action: Select drop down arrow for failure mode. \u2022 Also in the widget, we get information about our training data in the widget to help us decide when a model should be retrained. The Failure probability widget can show us how different failure modes impact our predictions. For example, it might show us our asset has a xx% probability of failure in the next xx months due to xx \u2022 Our Data Scientist can build specific models for time periods. And just like the failure modes, we can look at the results by making different selections within our widget. \u2022 Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode has changed over time. Action: Scroll to Failure probability trend card. The factors that contribute to failure show which factors from our training data impacted failures the most, giving us an indication of what may lead to future failures. Action: Scroll to Factors that contribute to failures card. Our anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history, and we can see when our asset exceeds that threshold in our widget. Action: Scroll to Anomaly detection history card. Asset Timeline At the bottom of the page, is an asset timeline that shows us several pieces of key information about our asset in the same graph. Action: Open Asset Timeline tab. For example, we can see that I have a predicted failure (on the top line of the graph), that will occur before our next planned maintenance (on the second line of the graph). Other information on the chart, like past work orders and inspection, provide valuable insight into our asset's history, and may support what kind of action we take. Action: Hover over predicted failure. While each piece of information, or widget, gives us insight into the state of our asset, all of the information together, gives us a richer view, and helps us make a data-driven decision on how to address this asset. Take Action Once I decide what action to take, I can do it immediately from the top of the asset detail page. Action: Scroll back to the top of the page and Select Action button in the right corner.

Review High Anomalies I'm the Remote Operational Support Manager that needs to view my assets across multiple cities worldwide. Monitor provides a single place to monitor all my mission critical assets around the globe from a single dashboard. Action: Open Maximo Application Suite and select Monitor Application. Open Monitor in the left Monitor Tab. Monitor has the data collected by devices organized by asset type. Operational support has some asset information in Monitor that was collected via Historians from SCADA or from devices that were connected to the IOT Platform. This facility has asset groups of sedimentation tanks and pumps. There is a summary dashboard for the asset type and instance dashboards for each asset. Action: Navigate to Entity called SedimentationTanks_LI and select the \u201cSedimentationTanks_LI\u201d tab Tank Monitoring/Inspecting I need to view cleanliness of sedimentation tanks in my facility. Over a period of time, tanks could build fungi or collect debris from environment or cases have been known for animals accidentally falling into our tanks. Every tank in our facility is constantly monitored by cameras. The feed from cameras are analyzed every hour by Maximo Visual Inspection\u2019s AI model and uploaded as IoT events. Maximo Monitor maps and plots these details on the dashboards as assets. Rules are triggered to generate alerts. Monitor provides a single dashboard to review and act on alerts for all tanks around the facility. The summary dashboard tells me that Tank 2 is showing alerts. I navigate to the Tank 2 instance dashboard to review and act on alerts for the tank. Action: Navigate to the Tank2 instance dashboard, select the \u201cTank Dashboard tab\u201d, then filter on severity of alerts in alert card I can tell by the alerts that the tank is getting to a critical status. The table card shows a list of rows pertaining to events for the specified tanks, with attributes identifying clean or dirty tanks. You can check the score of confidence in the \u201cLink to Image\u201d column to substantiate the findings. Action: Click the link against a tank identified as dirty Note When you click through to Maximo Visual Inspection, you MAY be taken to the login screen in a new browser window. Press continue, then CLOSE the tab, then click through again. You can visualize a dirty tank and conclude a need for maintenance. Action: Navigate back to Monitor and create a Service Request to clean the tank. Now that I have verified the tank being dirty, I create a service order to address the finding. Action: Create a service request for Tank2 either from the dashboard tab OR the alert tab Pump Monitoring Now I want to investigate my pumps. Action: Select Pump under Change asset type to bring up the Pump summary dashboard or the monitor tab type in \u201cPump\u201d. Then select the Pump tab. You can close the sidebar to increase the viewing area for the dashboard. The summary dashboard shows me a global map of sites of pumps and metrics, and gives real-time insights on problems with my assets. Dashboards are fully customizable and allow the operations manager to scale across multiple sites in a single dashboard to identify most urgent and critical problems. I see from the map that there were alerts against one of the pumps at that location. Action: Hover over the anomaly on the map. Note: Viewing dashboard from Dashboard tab on left. I drill down into the Bedford site to see the summary dashboard for the pumps there. Action: Filter on the Bedford site Action: Expand the alert card to full screen I will filter on the High severity alerts and see that there were recent alerts on Pump 005. Action: Filter on High severity alerts I drill in to take a closer look at Pump 005. Notice how the alert navigates to the time date where the anomaly happened in the asset dashboard. Action: Click on PMPDEVICE005. Then select the \u201cAsset Metrics Dashboard\u201d tab. The site map saves me time by showing me where this pump is located on the Bedford site as well as the anomaly alerts. The picture of the pump shows me which part of the pump is experiencing a problem. Review Asset History I can easily look at the asset history in Maximo from the table card and see that there was service done several days ago on this pump. Perhaps, it was improperly serviced which is now causing the vibrations. Action: Review Asset information in Maximo Manage. Right click on asset id link and open in new tab to see when the asset was serviced. It looks like the water pump bearing housing and seals were replaced a couple days ago. The pump ran normal for the rest of the day, but then began to vibrate again in the evening. Action: Click on Work tab. Filter on COMP to find the most recent work order. Having this data at hand, allows the operations engineer to gain insights on the history of the asset to make informed decisions on how to proceed with maintenance. Alert Thresholds I dig deeper into investigation of the problem by looking at the alerts. There are many alerts on this pump to look at. Monitor provides a paradigm shift from traditional threshold-based alerts that becomes overwhelming to AI powered anomaly alerts to remove the false positives. I filter on the high severity alerts and see there are just a few anomaly alerts. Action: Go back to asset dashboard in monitor, Show alerts table Vibration and Temperature are working in unison. The Vector is a combination of Velocity in the X, Y, Z axis. When all three experience exceptional vibration simultaneously there is something obviously very wrong with the asset. Action: Navigate to the \u201cVelocity \u2013 7 day Average\u201d card Create Service Request I go back to the alerts and create a service request in Maximo for the Maintenance Supervisor to look at to see why vibrations have returned since the seals were recently replaced. The Technician will reinspect the pump since he thought he fixed the vibration issue the last time it was worked on. Action: Go back to alert table, scroll the to the right side and click \u201cCreate Service Request\u201d. Action: Type in ROSE as the Reported By. This is used to trigger the escalations that process the Service Request\u2019s to Work Order\u2019s assigned to ELI for the mobile portion of the demo. Anomaly Function Let's go back to the asset type and we can see there are live metrics flowing into the system like the Velocity vector. Action: Navigate to \"Setup\" in the left navigation and choose Pump Action: Click on Set up device type and choose the Data tab. Action: Click on VELOCITYX Built in AI models can be applied in Monitor with just a few clicks with no data science or development experience needed. Models can also be created in Watson Machine Learning and used with Monitor. Action: View the different types of OOTB function that can be applied, or custom functions such as the vector.

These policies range from having lone technicians check in at periodic intervals or when then arrive/depart a job site. Safety regulations require the lone worker to be provided a communication device and do not specify the regularity of the communication. Thus, little insight to the safety and wellbeing of a lone worker is known and when assistance is needed, it often is known later than it could be. Additionally, one of the top safety violations that clients are fined with is in regard to safety hazard communications. Clients ask one question \u201cHow do I protect my lone workers\u201d Man Down Event Now that the work order has been completed the technician, who is also a lone worker, is leave the work area. While leaving the technician slips and falls because of moisture on the floor that was not easily detected due to low light. The technician hits their head and is non-responsive. The technician is equipped with wearable IoT sensors and additional IoT sensors are in the work environment. The Sensor data is utilized by Maximo Safety to detect client identified safety risk concerns with near real time analytical rules that go beyond what a single sensor can do by aggregating all the sensor data to provide necessary context. In this case one sensor has detected a fall, another sensor has detected no movement for 30 seconds and another has detected an elevated or abnormal heart rate and triggers a \u201cMan Down \u201cevent with the event location. The Man Down event is communicated by the Event action (Shield) engine to the technician\u2019s supervisor, which determines immediate action to get assistance for the lone technician. Time matters when someone is injured. Additionally, the event and location are provided to the Maximo Safety system for historical analytics. Hot Spots As the Safety Officer, I'll use Maximo Safety to identify areas of concern based on the identified Hot Spots so those areas can be investigated, and action taken to avoid future incidents. Action: Go to Maximo Safety, examine the \u201cHotSpots\u201d on the Dashboard. With the Hotspots the Safety Officer can determine areas of high risk, based upon the number of Safety events captured. This leading metric may be identifying actual incidents as well as near misses. If you minimize the \u201cnear misses\u201d you minimize the number of minor and major events and thus the number of injuries. Action: Filter on identified Location to focus on that particular area.
